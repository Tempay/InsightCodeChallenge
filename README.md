#Fan Site Analytics

## Summary

In this [code challenge](https://github.com/InsightDataScience/fansite-analytics-challenge), I implemented all 4 required features by Java. Also, I added some flexibilities into this implementation  so that we can define the input/output path and some factors (list more than 10 hosts in output file, etc)

Due to personal schedule, I only have a day to finish this, thus the project structure have not been optimized yet. (Some code might not separated and encapsulate into meaningful method/class).
